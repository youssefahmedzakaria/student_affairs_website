        Welcome to our student management website! Our platform is designed to make it easy for users to manage
        student
        information, with features including adding, updating, and deleting student records, as well as searching
        for active
        students by name and assigning departments to specific students. Our intuitive interface is designed to make
        these tasks
        as straightforward and user-friendly as possible, with clear prompts and guidance at every step. In
        addition, our
        platform allows you to view all active and inactive students in a separate page, with the ability to change
        their status
        with just a few clicks. <br><br><br>
