            Welcome to our student management website! Our platform is designed to make it easy for users to manage
            student
            information, with features including adding, updating, and deleting student records, as well as searching
            for active
            students by name and assigning departments to specific students. Our intuitive interface is designed to make
            these tasks
            as straightforward and user-friendly as possible, with clear prompts and guidance at every step. In
            addition, our
            platform allows you to view all active and inactive students in a separate page, with the ability to change
            their status
            with just a few clicks. With a well-designed navigation bar and a clear and informative home page, we're
            committed to
            providing you with the tools you need to manage student records with confidence and ease.
