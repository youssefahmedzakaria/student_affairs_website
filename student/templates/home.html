    Welcome to our student management website! Our platform is designed to make it easy for users to manage
    student
    information, with features including adding, updating, and deleting student records, as well as searching
    for active
    students by name and assigning departments to specific students. Our intuitive interface is designed to make
    these tasks
    as straightforward and user-friendly as possible, with clear prompts and guidance at every step. In
    addition, our
    platform allows you to view all active and inactive students in a separate page, with the ability to change
    their status
    with just a few clicks. <br><br><br>
